		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Install Chart.js Dependencies and Project Setup",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Chart.js installation and project setup into specific steps for dependency management, environment configuration, and initial component structure.",
			"reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward but involves multiple steps that could benefit from clear separation."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Static RealTimePriceChart Component with Dark Theme",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the creation of the static RealTimePriceChart component into subtasks for chart configuration, dual y-axes setup, dark theme styling, and initial data structure implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple complex aspects of Chart.js configuration and styling, warranting a more detailed breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement WebSocket Data Stream Hook",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the WebSocket data stream hook implementation into subtasks for connection management, data parsing, error handling, reconnection logic, and state management.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex asynchronous operations and state management, requiring careful separation of concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Interactive Tooltip and Chart Interactions",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the tooltip and interaction configuration into subtasks for custom tooltip implementation, shared tooltip behavior, and styling enhancements.",
			"reasoning": "While moderately complex, this task is more focused and can be effectively managed with fewer subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Performance Optimizations and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide performance optimizations and error handling into subtasks for data throttling, update batching, memory management, error boundaries, reconnection logic, UI state management, and monitoring setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers a wide range of critical production-ready features, each requiring careful implementation and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Replace Legacy Component and Final Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the legacy component replacement into subtasks for import updates, prop compatibility checks, documentation updates, and final integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "While not highly complex technically, this task involves careful coordination and testing to ensure smooth integration without regressions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Real-time Data with Chart Component",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration of real-time Market Price and Order Price data streams with the Chart.js component into specific implementation steps, including data fetching, transformation, chart updates, and performance optimizations.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating multiple real-time data streams, implementing data transformations, handling synchronization, and optimizing performance. It requires working with WebSockets, Chart.js, and complex state management, making it a high-complexity task that would benefit from being broken down into smaller, manageable subtasks."
